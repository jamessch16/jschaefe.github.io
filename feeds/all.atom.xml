of Albany than Cornwall.
GLOUCESTER  It did always seem so to us, but now in
the division of the kingdom, it appears not which
of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so
weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice
of either’s moiety.
KENT  Is not this your son, my lord?
GLOUCESTER  His breeding, sir, hath been at my
charge. I have so often blushed to acknowledge
him that now I am brazed to ’t.
KENT  I cannot conceive you.
GLOUCESTER  Sir, this young fellow’s mother could,
whereupon she grew round-wombed and had indeed,
sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband
for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
KENT  I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
being so proper.
GLOUCESTER  But I have a son, sir, by order of law,
some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in
my account. Though this knave came something
saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was
his mother fair, there was good sport at his making,
and the whoreson must be acknowledged.—Do you
know this noble gentleman, Edmund?
EDMUND  No, my lord.
GLOUCESTER  My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter
as my honorable friend.
EDMUND  My services to your Lordship.
KENT  I must love you and sue to know you better.
EDMUND  Sir, I shall study deserving.
GLOUCESTER  He hath been out nine years, and away he
shall again. (Sennet.) The King is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan,
Cordelia, and Attendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEAR 
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,
Gloucester.
GLOUCESTER  I shall, my lord.He exits.
LEAR 
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.—
Give me the map there.He is handed a map.
Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom, and ’tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age,
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
Unburdened crawl toward death. Our son of
Cornwall
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife
May be prevented now.
The two great princes, France and Burgundy,
Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
And here are to be answered. Tell me, my
daughters—
Since now we will divest us both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state—
Which of you shall we say doth love us most,
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Our eldest born, speak first.
GONERIL 
Sir, I love you more than word can wield the
matter,
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;
As much as child e’er loved, or father found;
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
CORDELIA, aside 
What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.
LEAR, pointing to the map 
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shadowy forests and with champains riched,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady. To thine and Albany’s issue
Be this perpetual.—What says our second
daughter,
Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.
REGAN 
I am made of that self mettle as my sister
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love;
Only she comes too short, that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense
possesses,
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear Highness’ love.
CORDELIA, aside  Then poor Cordelia!
And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s
More ponderous than my tongue.
LEAR 
To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
No less in space, validity, and pleasure
Than that conferred on Goneril.—Now, our joy,
Although our last and least, to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interessed, what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters’? Speak.
CORDELIA  Nothing, my lord.
LEAR  Nothing?
CORDELIA  Nothing.
LEAR 
Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.
CORDELIA 
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty
According to my bond, no more nor less.
LEAR 
How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,
Lest you may mar your fortunes.
CORDELIA  Good my lord,
You have begot me, bred me, loved me.
I return those duties back as are right fit:
Obey you, love you, and most honor you.
Why have my sisters husbands if they say
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall
carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.
LEAR  But goes thy heart with this?
CORDELIA  Ay, my good lord.
LEAR  So young and so untender?
CORDELIA  So young, my lord, and true.
LEAR 
Let it be so. Thy truth, then, be thy dower,
For by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate and the night,
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be,
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity, and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this forever. The barbarous
Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved
As thou my sometime daughter.
KENT  Good my liege—
LEAR  Peace, Kent.
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery. To Cordelia. Hence and avoid
my sight!—
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Her father’s heart from her.—Call France. Who stirs?
Call Burgundy. An Attendant exits. Cornwall and
Albany,
With my two daughters’ dowers digest the third.
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
I do invest you jointly with my power,
Preeminence, and all the large effects
That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,
With reservation of an hundred knights
By you to be sustained, shall our abode
Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain
The name and all th’ addition to a king.
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Belovèd sons, be yours, which to confirm,
This coronet part between you.
KENT  Royal Lear,
Whom I have ever honored as my king,
Loved as my father, as my master followed,
As my great patron thought on in my prayers—
LEAR 
The bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft.
KENT 
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
The region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor’s
bound
When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,
And in thy best consideration check
This hideous rashness. Answer my life my
judgment,
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds
Reverb no hollowness.
LEAR  Kent, on thy life, no more.
KENT 
My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thine enemies, nor fear to lose
it,
Thy safety being motive.
LEAR  Out of my sight!
KENT 
See better, Lear, and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye.
LEAR  Now, by Apollo—
KENT  Now, by Apollo, king,
Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.
LEAR  O vassal! Miscreant!
ALBANY/CORNWALL  Dear sir, forbear.
KENT 
Kill thy physician, and thy fee bestow
Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,
I’ll tell thee thou dost evil.
LEAR 
Hear me, recreant; on thine allegiance, hear me!
That thou hast sought to make us break our vows—
Which we durst never yet—and with strained pride
To come betwixt our sentence and our power,
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
Our potency made good, take thy reward:
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from disasters of the world,
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom. If on the tenth day following
Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions,
The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
This shall not be revoked.
KENT 
Fare thee well, king. Sith thus thou wilt appear,
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
To Cordelia. The gods to their dear shelter take
thee, maid,
That justly think’st and hast most rightly said.
To Goneril and Regan. And your large speeches
may your deeds approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love.—
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.
He’ll shape his old course in a country new.
He exits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flourish. Enter Gloucester with France, and Burgundy,
and Attendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLOUCESTER 
Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
LEAR  My lord of Burgundy,
We first address toward you, who with this king
Hath rivaled for our daughter. What in the least
Will you require in present dower with her,
Or cease your quest of love?
BURGUNDY  Most royal Majesty,
I crave no more than hath your Highness offered,
Nor will you tender less.
LEAR  Right noble Burgundy,
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,
But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands.
If aught within that little seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced
And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
She’s there, and she is yours.
BURGUNDY  I know no answer.
LEAR 
Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
Dowered with our curse and strangered with our
oath,
Take her or leave her?
BURGUNDY  Pardon me, royal sir,
Election makes not up in such conditions.
LEAR 
Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me
I tell you all her wealth.—For you, great king,
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate. Therefore beseech you
T’ avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed
Almost t’ acknowledge hers.
FRANCE  This is most strange,
That she whom even but now was your best
object,
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favor. Sure her offense
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it, or your forevouched affection
Fall into taint; which to believe of her
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Should never plant in me.
CORDELIA, to Lear  I yet beseech your Majesty—
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not, since what I well
intend
I’ll do ’t before I speak—that you make known
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
No unchaste action or dishonored step
That hath deprived me of your grace and favor,
But even for want of that for which I am richer:
A still-soliciting eye and such a tongue
That I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.
LEAR  Better thou
Hadst not been born than not t’ have pleased me
better.
FRANCE 
Is it but this—a tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do?—My lord of Burgundy,
What say you to the lady? Love’s not love
When it is mingled with regards that stands
Aloof from th’ entire point. Will you have her?
She is herself a dowry.
BURGUNDY, to Lear  Royal king,
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundy.
LEAR 
Nothing. I have sworn. I am firm.
BURGUNDY, to Cordelia 
I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband.
CORDELIA  Peace be with
Burgundy.
Since that respect and fortunes are his love,
I shall not be his wife.
FRANCE 
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor;
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised,
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon,
Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away.
Gods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st
neglect
My love should kindle to enflamed respect.—
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my
chance,
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.
Not all the dukes of wat’rish Burgundy
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.—
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
Thou losest here a better where to find.
LEAR 
Thou hast her, France. Let her be thine, for we
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
That face of hers again. To Cordelia. Therefore
begone
Without our grace, our love, our benison.—
Come, noble Burgundy.
Flourish. All but France, Cordelia,
Goneril, and Regan exit.
FRANCE  Bid farewell to your sisters.
CORDELIA 
The jewels of our father, with washed eyes
Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named. Love well our
father.
To your professèd bosoms I commit him;
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
I would prefer him to a better place.
So farewell to you both.
REGAN 
Prescribe not us our duty.
GONERIL  Let your study
Be to content your lord, who hath received you
At Fortune’s alms. You have obedience scanted
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
CORDELIA 
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides,
Who covers faults at last with shame derides.
Well may you prosper.
FRANCE  Come, my fair Cordelia.
France and Cordelia exit.
GONERIL  Sister, it is not little I have to say of what
most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
father will hence tonight.
REGAN  That’s most certain, and with you; next month
with us.
GONERIL  You see how full of changes his age is; the
observation we have made of it hath not been
little. He always loved our sister most, and with
what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
appears too grossly.
REGAN  ’Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever
but slenderly known himself.
GONERIL  The best and soundest of his time hath been
but rash. Then must we look from his age to
receive not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with
them.
REGAN  Such unconstant starts are we like to have
from him as this of Kent’s banishment.
GONERIL  There is further compliment of leave-taking
between France and him. Pray you, let us sit
together. If our father carry authority with such
disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will
but offend us.
REGAN  We shall further think of it.
GONERIL  We must do something, and i’ th’ heat.
They exit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>My Third Article</title><link href="https://github.com/jamessch16/jschaefe.github.io/my-third-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-10-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>James Schaefer-Pham</name></author><id>tag:github.com,2023-10-03:/jamessch16/jschaefe.github.io/my-third-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;EDMUND

Thou, Nature, art my goddess. To thy law
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother? why “bastard”? Wherefore “base,”
When my dimensions are as well compact,
My mind as generous and my shape as true
As honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us
With “base,” with “baseness,” “bastardy,” “base,”
“base,”
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth within a dull, stale, tired bed
Go to th’ creating a whole tribe of fops
Got ’tween asleep and wake? Well then,
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.
Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund
As to th’ legitimate. Fine word, “legitimate.”
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Shall top th’ legitimate. I grow, I prosper.
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Gloucester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLOUCESTER 
Kent banished thus? And France in choler parted?
And the King gone tonight, prescribed his power,
Confined to exhibition? All this done
Upon the gad?—Edmund, how now? What news?
EDMUND  So please your Lordship, none. He puts a
paper in his pocket.
GLOUCESTER  Why so earnestly seek you to put up that
letter?
EDMUND  I know no news, my lord.
GLOUCESTER  What paper were you reading?
EDMUND  Nothing, my lord.
GLOUCESTER  No? What needed then that terrible dispatch
of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing
hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come, if
it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
EDMUND  I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter
from my brother that I have not all o’erread; and
for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for
your o’erlooking.
GLOUCESTER  Give me the letter, sir.
EDMUND  I shall offend either to detain or give it. The
contents, as in part I understand them, are to
blame.
GLOUCESTER  Let’s see, let’s see.
Edmund gives him the paper.
EDMUND  I hope, for my brother’s justification, he
wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
GLOUCESTER (reads)  This policy and reverence of age
makes the world bitter to the best of our times, keeps
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the
oppression of aged tyranny, who sways not as it hath
power but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I
may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked
him, you should enjoy half his revenue forever and
live the beloved of your brother. Edgar.
Hum? Conspiracy? “Sleep till I wake him, you
should enjoy half his revenue.” My son Edgar! Had
he a hand to write this? A heart and brain to breed it
in?—When came you to this? Who brought it?
EDMUND  It was not brought me, my lord; there’s the
cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement
of my closet.
GLOUCESTER  You know the character to be your
brother’s?
EDMUND  If the matter were good, my lord, I durst
swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would
fain think it were not.
GLOUCESTER  It is his.
EDMUND  It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is
not in the contents.
GLOUCESTER  Has he never before sounded you in this
business?
EDMUND  Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and
fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the
son, and the son manage his revenue.
GLOUCESTER  O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
letter. Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish
villain! Worse than brutish!—Go, sirrah, seek
him. I’ll apprehend him.—Abominable villain!—
Where is he?
EDMUND  I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
you to suspend your indignation against my brother
till you can derive from him better testimony of his
intent, you should run a certain course; where, if
you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
purpose, it would make a great gap in your own
honor and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience.
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath
writ this to feel my affection to your Honor, and to
no other pretense of danger.
GLOUCESTER  Think you so?
EDMUND  If your Honor judge it meet, I will place you
where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that
without any further delay than this very evening.
GLOUCESTER  He cannot be such a monster.
EDMUND  Nor is not, sure.
GLOUCESTER  To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
loves him! Heaven and Earth! Edmund, seek him
out; wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the
business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
myself to be in a due resolution.
EDMUND  I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the
business as I shall find means, and acquaint you
withal.
GLOUCESTER  These late eclipses in the sun and moon
portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of
nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds
itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,
friendship falls off, brothers divide; in cities, mutinies;
in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and
the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This villain
of mine comes under the prediction: there’s son
against father. The King falls from bias of nature:
there’s father against child. We have seen the best of
our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and
all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our
graves.—Find out this villain, Edmund. It shall
lose thee nothing. Do it carefully.—And the noble
and true-hearted Kent banished! His offense, honesty!
’Tis strange.He exits.
EDMUND  This is the excellent foppery of the world, that
when we are sick in fortune (often the surfeits of
our own behavior) we make guilty of our disasters
the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains
on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves,
thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced
obedience of planetary influence; and all that we
are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable
evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
disposition on the charge of a star! My father
compounded with my mother under the Dragon’s
tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it
follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should
have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the
firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Edgar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a
sigh like Tom o’ Bedlam.—O, these eclipses do
portend these divisions. Fa, sol, la, mi.
EDGAR  How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation
are you in?
EDMUND  I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
EDGAR  Do you busy yourself with that?
EDMUND  I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
unhappily, as of unnaturalness between the
child and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of
ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences,
banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,
nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
EDGAR  How long have you been a sectary
astronomical?
EDMUND  Come, come, when saw you my father last?
EDGAR  The night gone by.
EDMUND  Spake you with him?
EDGAR  Ay, two hours together.
EDMUND  Parted you in good terms? Found you no
displeasure in him by word nor countenance?
EDGAR  None at all.
EDMUND  Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
him, and at my entreaty forbear his presence
until some little time hath qualified the heat
of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in
him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay.
EDGAR  Some villain hath done me wrong.
EDMUND  That’s my fear. I pray you have a continent
forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower;
and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from
whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.
Pray you go. There’s my key. If you do stir abroad,
go armed.
EDGAR  Armed, brother?
EDMUND  Brother, I advise you to the best. I am no
honest man if there be any good meaning toward
you. I have told you what I have seen and heard, but
faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray
you, away.
EDGAR  Shall I hear from you anon?
EDMUND  I do serve you in this business.Edgar exits.
A credulous father and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy. I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.
All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.
He exits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry></feed>
